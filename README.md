## Cocktail Party Speech Dataset

This dataset contains binaurally-rendered audio for testing speech isolation and recognition systems on "cocktail party" scenarios. Each audio file contains a target talker and 0-6 distracting talkers. The test_set.csv file outlines each file, the number of distractors the file contains, the rendering method, and the target transcript. The audio files can be downloaded here: [cocktail_party_audio_dataset.tgz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VDP71GSocK2LSOTim__Texeu23KUpK_v/view?usp=sharing).

The human_participant_responses folder contains the participant responses on the test audio. Punctuation has been removed with the exception of the apostrophes/single quote characters, which have been replaced with  underscores.

Information regarding the different rendering methods can be found [here](https://opus.uleth.ca/handle/10133/5815).
